Great question! Expanding your watchdog app beyond just URL uptime checks can really boost its usefulness and attract more users. Here are some ideas for additional services you could offer:

1. Performance Monitoring
Response Time Tracking: Monitor how long the server takes to respond.

Page Load Speed: Measure full page load time including assets.

Detailed Metrics: CPU, memory, bandwidth usage (if you can integrate agents or APIs).

2. SSL/TLS Certificate Monitoring
Alert users when certificates are about to expire or if there are issues with SSL configuration.

3. API Endpoint Monitoring
Check REST or GraphQL APIs for expected status codes, response schemas, or specific data values.

4. Transaction or Workflow Monitoring
Simulate user workflows or critical transactions (e.g., login, checkout) and alert if they fail.

5. Content Verification
Check for presence or absence of specific keywords/text or HTML elements on a page.

6. Port and Service Monitoring
Beyond HTTP/HTTPS, monitor TCP ports or specific services (SSH, FTP, SMTP) for availability.

7. DNS Monitoring
Verify that DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) resolve correctly and alert on changes.

8. Resource Usage Alerts
If you manage agent software on servers, monitor CPU, RAM, disk space, or process statuses.

9. Error Rate Tracking
Monitor error rates from logs or application metrics to catch spikes.

10. Incident Reporting and Analytics
Provide dashboards with historical uptime, downtime, MTTR (mean time to repair), and other analytics.

11. Multi-location Checks
Verify site availability from multiple geographic regions to detect regional outages.

12. Security Monitoring
Scan for vulnerabilities, SSL configuration issues, or blacklisting.

13. Customizable Alerts
Alert via multiple channels like SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or custom webhooks.

14. Maintenance Window Scheduling
Allow users to schedule maintenance windows to suppress false alerts.

15. Status Pages
Generate public or private status pages showing system health for end users or clients.
